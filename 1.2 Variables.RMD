Vectors must have their values all of the same mode but can have NA values while lists are recursive and can have different modes of values. 

Atomic variables: numeric, character, logical, complex, raw

# Numeric vectors
```{r}
N1 <- numeric()
N1[3] <- 11
print(N1)

N2 <- c(2 * 1:5)
print(N2)
```


# Character vectors
```{r}
C1 <- paste("X", c(1:10), sep = "")
print(C1)
```


# Logical vectors
```{r}
x  <- 15
L1 <- c(x > 13 & x < 22, x > 100)
print(L1)
```


# Mode (object type) and Length (vector length)
```{r}
mode(C1)
length(C1)
```
