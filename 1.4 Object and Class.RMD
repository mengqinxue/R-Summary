All variables in R are objects and all objects have a class. 


# Add attributes
```{r}
a <- c(1:5)
attr(a, "name") <- "Numeric Vector"
print(a)
```


# Unclass
```{r}
unclass(a)
```


# Methods of a class
```{r}
methods(class="data.frame")
```


# Methods of a generic function
Generic funciton plot can be considered as an interface and different classes have different implementations. 
```{r}
mode(plot)
methods(plot)
```
